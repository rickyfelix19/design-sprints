# Design Sprints
The idea of naming it **Design Sprints** is to showcase my ability in replicating as many website as possible.

## Table of Contents

- [About](#about)
- [Getting Started](#getting_started)
- [Replicate](#replicate)

## About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo is to help me prepare for a Web Dev job interview to showcase my abilities in basic web development: HTML and CSS for brushing up my basic skills and CSS 
This repo will be separated into multiple stages: 
1. Static (HTML and CSS) 
2. and Dynamic (JS)

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Use ```flush.css``` to empty out css of a certain page
NOTE: AVOID USING THIS

### Prerequisites

This repo requires me to know:
- HTML

For later stages:v
- JSON / XML / SQL
